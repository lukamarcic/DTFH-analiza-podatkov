Eric wanted to ensure that people could have legal access to psilocybin, in a place where they could feel safe and not worry about legal repercussions. He had witnessed the healing effects of psilocybin too many times to give up. Regardless of the legal status of psilocybin in the United States and most other parts of the world, Eric knew this was his calling. Having spent many of his younger adult years in Jamaica, one of the few countries where psilocybin remains legal, he knew he’d found the perfect location for the center."

Later that year, he studied Ayahuasca shamanism under various Peruvian shamans on the Aucayacu River in the Amazon rain forest, approximately 24 hours away from Iquitos, Peru by boat. Then, in 2002, Souther began apprenticing with Don Alberto Torres Davila and Don Julio Llerena Pinedo, two medicine men in the area. Souther constructed a camp nearby, where he would live during his studies. It soon became clear to him that many Westerners would benefit from similar spiritual work, so he established Blue Morpho, named after the bright blue Amazonian butterfly of the same name. With its inception, Souther began guiding guests on the 24-hour trip by boat from Iquitos deep into the jungle. As more guests arrived, he added greater infrastructure to accommodate their needs."
