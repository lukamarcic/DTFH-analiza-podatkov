Later that year, he studied Ayahuasca shamanism under various Peruvian shamans on the Aucayacu River in the Amazon rain forest, approximately 24 hours away from Iquitos, Peru by boat.  Then, in 2002, Souther began apprenticing with Don Alberto Torres Davila and Don Julio Llerena Pinedo, two medicine men in the area. Souther constructed a camp nearby, where he would live during his studies. It soon became clear to him that many Westerners would benefit from similar spiritual work, so he established Blue Morpho, named after the bright blue Amazonian butterfly of the same name. With its inception, Souther began guiding guests on the 24-hour trip by boat from Iquitos deep into the jungle. As more guests arrived, he added greater infrastructure to accommodate their needs. "
